Greetings, Manager. 
I see that you've been slacking off while playing a few rounds of cards during our work hours. 
I am unfamiliar with playing cards myself, but I am able to modify this little game of yours so that you can still have "fun" while still generating precious energy to meet the daily quota. 
This may hinder your playing experience, but I am sure you will do just fine.</i></h5>

## Note: The latest version is 1.0.0-pre4, which can be found in the [releases tab](https://github.com/Mysthaps/LobotomyCorp/releases). The full 1.0.0 is still being worked on, sorry for the inconvenience!

# Features
## Abnormalities, as Jokers
Each added Abnormality have different Observation Levels that unlock more of their Information. 
This is based on the amount of rounds played with that Abnormality in your Joker slots.

## Abnormalities, as Boss Blinds
Some Abnormalities are able to ***breach***. 
In addition, some breaching Abnormalities can change the upcoming fights to be an Abnormality as a Boss Blind. 
These blinds are very hard to take down, make sure you're well-prepared before tackling on these challenges.

## Extraction Pack
To help with discovering Abnormalities, a new **Booster Pack** type is added. 
This pack allows you to pick one of three Abnormalities to add to your Joker slots.

## Ordeals
During the run, **Ordeals** can replace some blinds. These blinds are generally more difficult to take down compared to the other blinds, 
with **Dawn Ordeals** being the easiest, and **Midnight Ordeals** being much a lot tougher to overcome.

## Challenges
In some Challenges, Ordeals are guaranteed to appear. In others, you might be fighting **[[[INFORMATION REDACTED]]]**. 
Good luck, Manager. You will need it.
